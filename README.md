# Chat-Socket_Programming

Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

To run this program:
1. Open two terminal
2. Run server.c (gcc server.c) and client.c (gcc client.c) in separate terminal.
3. Run ./a.out in both terminal
4. Send message from client side.
